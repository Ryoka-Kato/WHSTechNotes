The new cell phone rule
I think the new cell phone law is not bad ,since it helps us concentrate on our work and prevents people from cheating with AI. I'm adjusting to it by bringing a watch to school so I can check time without using my phone. Challeges I see is that you can't use cell phone when I might need to reset my password when I forget it.

A career that I'm interested in is game program/development. Computer sicence could be vauluable in that career because, it can give more freedom to do many things. For example from the 3ds to switch, the graphics increased and can process more data at once so there can be more things available to do.

Presidential AI challenge
A way I think AI can be used efficiently and help the community is to build a AI that can talk to old poeple any time. This idea meets the requirements because it has a positive effect on the health of people using it and the mental health of people around the user. This idea is useful beacsue it can prevent dementia and from feeling lonely. There is a study shown that social connection/ communication can prevent becoming dementia so fast. Also about the lonelyness, if there was something to communicate to there will be less cahnce of depression.

I think that working in a vertual store for real money is a good idea for the future. I think this way because in the future I think that there will be more jobs that use remote controls to make machine do things. IKEA is doing vertual jobs like restocking shelves, serving food, and helping customers. I think that all of the jobs that IKEA is providing has a probavility being replaced by robots. This virtual job experiment can help IKEA and the current virtual workers to get ahead in the future work force.

I don't really know what "67" means. But I have been hearing it from many people from many classes. I barely remember my sister telling me that it was a part of a song. I believe that people use them whenever they hear or say either 6 or 7. People are joking around with when they use the "67" phrase. I think there's no meaning to "67".

If I was in charge of my own school The policy would be that, I would block AI and certain school inapropriate games/ sites. I would allow cell phones only during passing period and lunch. I will use lock down browser to lock chromebooks while students do the assighnments, but after the students have confirmed that they finished alol their work then the teachers will unlock the chromebook so the students can play games or search stuff. I would make a section in the classroom near a teacher to turn in the phones so that no students can cheat or use AI. I would allow phones outside the classroom because there is no reason to perhibit phones. I would also make the teachers to not use their personal phones unless it is an emergency or told by the school to check.

The promt was designed to teach students what the quadratic formula is. Also it was desighned to let students practice the formula with questions at the end. Canva interacted just fine but I had to add more statements so that the sheet was more efficient. The part that worked the best was that the AI created a system that lets students see how the formula works by simply putting in what the A, B, C of the formula would be. I think I can improve the prompt by making a place to adjust the difficulty of the explanation and questions because, if it was too hard then some people may not understand and will not be a practice.
