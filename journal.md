The new cell phone rule
I think the new cell phone law is not bad ,since it helps us concentrate on our work and prevents people from cheating with AI. I'm adjusting to it by bringing a watch to school so I can check time without using my phone. Challeges I see is that you can't use cell phone when I might need to reset my password when I forget it.

A career that I'm interested in is game program/development. Computer sicence could be vauluable in that career because, it can give more freedom to do many things. For example from the 3ds to switch, the graphics increased and can process more data at once so there can be more things available to do.
