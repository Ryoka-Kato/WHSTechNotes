The new cell phone rule
I think the new cell phone law is not bad ,since it helps us concentrate on our work and prevents people from cheating with AI. I'm adjusting to it by bringing a watch to school so I can check time without using my phone. Challeges I see is that you can't use cell phone when I might need to reset my password when I forget it.
