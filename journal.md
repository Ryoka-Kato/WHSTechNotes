The new cell phone rule
I think the new cell phone law is not bad ,since it helps us concentrate on our work and prevents people from cheating with AI. I'm adjusting to it by bringing a watch to school so I can check time without using my phone. Challeges I see is that you can't use cell phone when I might need to reset my password when I forget it.

A career that I'm interested in is game program/development. Computer sicence could be vauluable in that career because, it can give more freedom to do many things. For example from the 3ds to switch, the graphics increased and can process more data at once so there can be more things available to do.

Presidential AI challenge
A way I think AI can be used efficiently and help the community is to build a AI that can talk to old poeple any time. This idea meets the requirements because it has a positive effect on the health of people using it and the mental health of people around the user. This idea is useful beacsue it can prevent dementia and from feeling lonely. There is a study shown that social connection/ communication can prevent becoming dementia so fast. Also about the lonelyness, if there was something to communicate to there will be less cahnce of depression.

I think that working in a vertual store for real money is a good idea for the future. I think this way because in the future I think that there will be more jobs that use remote controls to make machine do things. IKEA is doing vertual jobs like restocking shelves, serving food, and helping customers. I think that all of the jobs that IKEA is providing has a probavility being replaced by robots. This virtual job experiment can help IKEA and the current virtual workers to get ahead in the future work force.

I don't really know what "67" means. But I have been hearing it from many people from many classes. I barely remember my sister telling me that it was a part of a song. I believe that people use them whenever they hear or say either 6 or 7. People are joking around with when they use the "67" phrase. I think there's no meaning to "67".

If I was in charge of my own school The policy would be that, I would block AI and certain school inapropriate games/ sites. I would allow cell phones only during passing period and lunch. I will use lock down browser to lock chromebooks while students do the assighnments, but after the students have confirmed that they finished alol their work then the teachers will unlock the chromebook so the students can play games or search stuff. I would make a section in the classroom near a teacher to turn in the phones so that no students can cheat or use AI. I would allow phones outside the classroom because there is no reason to perhibit phones. I would also make the teachers to not use their personal phones unless it is an emergency or told by the school to check.

The promt was designed to teach students what the quadratic formula is. Also it was desighned to let students practice the formula with questions at the end. Canva interacted just fine but I had to add more statements so that the sheet was more efficient. The part that worked the best was that the AI created a system that lets students see how the formula works by simply putting in what the A, B, C of the formula would be. I think I can improve the prompt by making a place to adjust the difficulty of the explanation and questions because, if it was too hard then some people may not understand and will not be a practice.

It is a big deal if the SNAP ran out of funding because the people who need help buying food because of money difficulties will not be able to get food and starve. Technologies might be able to help people find or access food by creating websites that have list of stores that gives out food or have food low price to the people with low income. Also there can be a time schedule for when free meals are given out by the city or a local governing group. The challenges that might exist in this is that low income families might not have access to internet or don't have a device that can be used to see those websites. If I was to design a tool to solve food insecurity I would make a place where people without internet can access the internet 30-60 minutes each day so that they can find things they need to get access to food.

Gratitude & Growth
The moment I was most proud of this semister was when I had to right a 2-3 page essay for college trandition class and made a full grade. This is was a resent achivement I got about a week ago. The essay was about how we can train our memories to be better at storing information. I worked on it for 2 weeks and cut down on some sleep to finish. All the work has worth it and got a full grade of that essay and got my grade up from 98.02 to 98.48.

Yes I am looking forward to Thanksgiving break I will be able to sleep long and will not have to go to school. I also have a plan for going to corpus. The only concern is that my college transition class might give me something to do since the break doesn't start until Thursday for college. If they give me something I will scream.

One job that uses drones is drone mapper. In that job programmers write codes for navigation of the drones and plan the missions and integrate sensors. The pay of this job is aproximately $54,020, but varies on experience and education. The average houry rate is $28.60. The education and certificate needed are FFA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate, and specialized software certifications like Pix4D and DroneDeploy. I would not do this job in the future because I'm more into game programming than drones.

I think that the self-driving car might fail to reconize the school bus stop sign because it appears almost randomly.The challenges the car's camera/ sensors might face is the distinguishment of normal stop signs and the school bus ones. Quick reconization of the sign also could be a challenge. If I was a programmer, a safety improvemnet I would add is to make a rule to slow down near stopped school buses no matter if they have the sign up or not. Another program might be to have a program inside the school bus to send a signal to the self-driving car and make then stop with that signal.

My plans for winter break is to first sleep and second to play games with my friends in Japan. I want to sleep because I couldn't get to sleep much with a bunch of homework. I will with my friends in Japan is because I can only play with them on days without school because of time difference.

The way I used technology over the breack was to eliminate boring time and searching stuff for school. To eliminate boring time I watched videos went of SNS. I also used my computer to play games with my friends. I used my phone to greet people at Japan a happy new years as well.

Autocraft was created so that people can create private servers so that there won't be people attacking or using foul language at them. Unmoderated online spaces could have threats, foul language, harassment,bullying, and many more harmful thngs because some people get angry to one another or just have fun doing those things. Safe spaces like Autocraft are needed in the internet because some people can get emotional, mental damage by the laguages used by some people. It can even lead to killing their selves because of that. Developers choices in that private servers can affect the user's experiences because if the rules and correspondence to problems are weak then there is almost no difference between the normal online server and the private server run by those developpers.

One way technology can help create a fair and just society is by enabling infamous individuals to raise their voices and be reconized. For example there are many places where people can interact with each other like, X, instagram, discord, and facebook. In these sites people are able to freely express their feeling more that the real world since it is anonimous. This can give opinions from different people and not just the ones that are able to standup and speak up in the public. To conclude, people can use technology to speak up and show their feelings without the power to have a voice in the real world.

The test I took on Tuesday and Wednesday is the MAP biology, reading, and lanuage. About my performance I feel confident in biology and feel decent in  the english test. The thing that helped me do successful in the biology MAP test is that I did every assignment and listened well in that class. The thing I can do to improve my english score might be to read more. Ithink the test prep is useful to me because I can see what kind of question is on the accutual test and prepare for it.

Self care and personal hygiene in shared spaces are important because it is a "shared" place you can get some one sick easily if you have a virouse and does not care about it. Loud conversations, strong smells and etc can make others stressed or sick and make them not into their work as much because of the stress or sickness. Some actions that are professional in these shared environments are, quiet conversations, being aware and have care to others in the environment. These behaviors are imporatant skills for the future bacause relaltionship between people are essencial for a productive workspace and for the social health of people.

I do not enjoy football because I don't know the rules or any players. For that reason I did not watch Superbowl this year.
