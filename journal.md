The new cell phone rule
I think the new cell phone law is not bad ,since it helps us concentrate on our work and prevents people from cheating with AI. I'm adjusting to it by bringing a watch to school so I can check time without using my phone. Challeges I see is that you can't use cell phone when I might need to reset my password when I forget it.

A career that I'm interested in is game program/development. Computer sicence could be vauluable in that career because, it can give more freedom to do many things. For example from the 3ds to switch, the graphics increased and can process more data at once so there can be more things available to do.

Presidential AI challenge
A way I think AI can be used efficiently and help the community is to build a AI that can talk to old poeple any time. This idea meets the requirements because it has a positive effect on the health of people using it and the mental health of people around the user. This idea is useful beacsue it can prevent dementia and from feeling lonely. There is a study shown that social connection/ communication can prevent becoming dementia so fast. Also about the lonelyness, if there was something to communicate to there will be less cahnce of depression.

I think that working in a vertual store for real money is a good idea for the future. I think this way because in the future I think that there will be more jobs that use remote controls to make machine do things. IKEA is doing vertual jobs like restocking shelves, serving food, and helping customers. I think that all of the jobs that IKEA is providing has a probavility being replaced by robots. This virtual job experiment can help IKEA and the current virtual workers to get ahead in the future work force.
